      <description>As Jonah and Henry discuss on their great new episode of Techlore Talks, the &amp;ldquo;nirvana fallacy&amp;rdquo; can be detrimental to productive discussion and meaningful progress. Simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s called an &amp;ldquo;informal fallacy&amp;rdquo;‚Äîor form of logical error‚Äîand might also be described as &amp;ldquo;all-or-nothing thinking&amp;rdquo;: if something isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, then it&amp;rsquo;s not valuable.
Who am I, why am I writing about errors, and should you listen to me? Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Kai! I&amp;rsquo;m writing about this particular error because I was inspired by the Techlore Talks episode that I mentioned.</description>

      <title>How to Use a Kindle Without an Amazon Account</title>
      <link>https://kaitebay.github.io/posts/kindle-without-account/</link>

      <description>I read quite a lot‚Äîfrom research papers to books and articles‚Äîand, while I love the old-school combo of a book and a hot drink, found myself looking for an eReader. For me, there are two main benefits: saving space when I travel, and avoiding distractions when I read. Although there are alternatives like Kobo eReaders or the reMarkable tablet, among others, the Amazon Kindle was my first choice.
 Depending on your threat model, you might prefer to avoid interacting with Amazon‚Äôs ecosystem.</description>

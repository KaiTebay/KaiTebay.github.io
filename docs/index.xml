      <description>The &amp;ldquo;nirvana fallacy&amp;rdquo; can be detrimental to productive discussion and meaningful progress. Simply put, it&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s called an &amp;ldquo;informal fallacy&amp;rdquo;—or form of logical error—and might also be described as &amp;ldquo;all-or-nothing thinking&amp;rdquo;: if something isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, then it&amp;rsquo;s not valuable.
Who am I, why am I writing about errors, and should you listen to me? Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Kai! Whether you listen to me is up to you, and whether you agree with me is another matter.</description>

      <title>How to Use a Kindle Without an Amazon Account</title>
      <link>https://kaitebay.github.io/posts/kindle-without-account/</link>

      <description>I read quite a lot—from research papers to books and articles—and, while I love the old-school combo of a book and a hot drink, found myself looking for an eReader. For me, there are two main benefits: saving space when I travel, and avoiding distractions when I read. Although there are alternatives like Kobo eReaders or the reMarkable tablet, among others, the Amazon Kindle was my first choice.
 Depending on your threat model, you might prefer to avoid interacting with Amazon’s ecosystem.</description>

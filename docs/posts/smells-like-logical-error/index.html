  "articleBody": "The “nirvana fallacy” can be detrimental to productive discussion and meaningful progress. Simply put, it’s what’s called an “informal fallacy”—or form of logical error—and might also be described as “all-or-nothing thinking”: if something isn’t perfect, then it’s not valuable.\nWho am I, why am I writing about errors, and should you listen to me? Hi, I’m Kai! Whether you listen to me is up to you, and whether you agree with me is another matter. It’d be nice if you listen to my thoughts (I have a degree in Philosophy), but I also encourage you to consult the references that I include!\nIn this article, I’m going to explain the pitfalls of all-or-nothing thinking: the nirvana fallacy and why it’s important; some of its consequences, like “gate-keeping”; and suggest a simple method of rectifying or avoiding it.\n“Why should I care?” Simply because of how errors work, there are a few situations you might find yourself in, so let’s identify what we’re talking about:\n Firstly, if you commit the Nirvana fallacy, it was either intentional or unintentional.  The idea of intentionally making an error might seem strange, but it might not be as weird as it seems: there are plenty of reasons to try and ‘defend’ what we already think.   Secondly, upon learning that you did commit the Nirvana fallacy, you either care or you don’t care.  By whether you “care”, I mean whether you are interested in rectifying it. For this article, I’m going to assume that you care, and therefore would either like to rectify errors you’ve made, or avoid them in the future.    So, with that out of the way…\nWhat is the Nirvana fallacy, and why is it important? As I mentioned, the Nirvana fallacy is a case of “all-or-nothing” or “black-and-white” thinking. Its Wikipedia article has some more information about it1, but here’s an example:\n Kai’s article isn’t going to get rid of the Nirvana fallacy, so it’s not a very good article.\n Since the goal of this article is to reduce, rather than eradicate, the Nirvana fallacy, this inference misses something important: what this article aims to do. Now, you might well still decide that this article isn’t very good, but—if your reason was the same as the example—you would have made an error.\nThe nirvana fallacy is particularly important because it’s so common—especially when it comes to important topics. Here, I’m contextualizing its presence in discussions about topics related to the right to privacy (e.g. between activists, advocates, volunteers, experts, and so on), but the non-specific concepts can be generalized more broadly.\nWhy avoid fallacies? The advantage of avoiding fallacies, including this one, is that it’s easier to make logically ‘valid’ arguments. If an argument is valid, then it’s often more convincing:\n It’s better to use a web-browser which respects your right to privacy. Google Chrome has a circular icon. Therefore, you should consider using an alternative, like Brave or Firefox.\n We might agree with the first premise, but there’s clearly an error in the conclusion we’ve drawn: if the first two things are true, then our conclusion should also be true.\n It’s better to use a web-browser which respects your right to privacy. Google Chrome doesn’t respect your right to privacy. Therefore, you should consider using an alternative, like Brave or Firefox.\n This conclusion seems more convincing because it’s logically valid: if the first two things are true, then the conclusion seems reasonable. Now, of course, we might disagree with any of those statements, so our argument might not be ‘sound’, but that’s a topic for another day.\nThe point is that avoiding fallacies makes it easier to make good arguments (or, at least, arguments which are more convincing). If you’re interested in exchanging ideas and discussing topics to progress everyone’s understanding, then making good arguments is essential.\nFruit and Vegetables Perhaps in characteristic style, I think that a vivid example might help to show why the nirvana fallacy is a particularly tricky case: it can lead to common practices, like “gate-keeping”, which aren’t very useful for discussion.\nAverage Fruit Enjoyer vs. Fruit-and-vegetable Enthusiast You’re something of an enthusiast for fruit and vegetables. Sure, your friends and family eat them, here and there, but they aren’t too bothered. The increase in eating processed foods has brought benefits like reducing harmful bacteria, making food quicker, easier, and less costly, and so on, but relying on it entirely has some drawbacks: too much salt, adverse health effects, and so on.\nYou, on the other hand, are passionate about fruit and vegetables: you know that they’re packed with good stuff; you think that people would see a lot of benefit from a few simple changes, like eating an apple-a-day; you even keep up with the latest developments (what the hell is a “cucamelon”?)\nSo, you find community with other fruit-and-vegetable advocates—a rich, diverse bunch of people: farmers, biologists, chefs, suppliers, consumers, policy-makers, nutritionists, and so on. Too many to count. Amongst you, the wide range of backgrounds, skill sets, and perspectives makes for great discussions:\n “Which berries do you start your day with?” “Are aggregate fruits just hype?” “Is the botanical classification of tomatoes misleading?”  Sure, you’re happy that you now only eat whole foods, blend your vegetables, grow your own produce, love hydroponics, and avoid processed sugar at all costs, but you can’t wait until the next harvest and its potential for even better produce. Your current setup isn’t perfect, yet. Also, you find yourself overwhelmed by the deluge of ‘beginner’ topics:\n “I don’t like bananas: do I have to eat them?” “Pineapple pizza should count as one of your five-a-day!” “Best allergy-respecting alternative to kiwis?”  You can answer these fairly easily, but you’re frustrated by the other answers. Obviously, if someone cares about their health, then things like “it’s okay to not like particular foods”, “eating pizza isn’t a sin”, and “try fruits that don’t trigger birch pollen allergies, like oranges” are stupid. Health is important. If you care about your health, it doesn’t matter if you don’t like the food. Pizza isn’t well-optimized for meeting a whole food diet, so it sucks. Just stop having allergies. Those are clear, for fruit-and-vegetable enthusiasts—like yourself.\nHowever, you notice that some of the other enthusiasts are a lot more successful in helping people to include fruit and vegetables in their diets. They advise the average fruit enjoyer to “try adding an apple to your lunchbox” and “add a few frozen peas to your instant ramen”. It’s weird: they aren’t even optimal, so why is it successful?\nThis thinly-veiled analogy illustrates the “gate-keeping” that all-or-nothing thinking can lead to. When it comes to evaluation, the nirvana fallacy causes a particularly nasty trap: if nothing is good enough, then every option is bad.\nPrivacy and Security For evaluative discussions about privacy and security, this can be detrimental to progress. In what follows, I’ll include examples which are specific to discussions about digital privacy and security, but the same concepts apply. In some cases, the nirvana fallacy occurs directly:\n Proton Mail is a bad email provider: they logged a customer’s IP address2.\n Let’s look at what the argument asserts:\n (An email provider is good only if it has no flaws). Proton Mail logged a customer’s IP address. (Logging a customer’s IP address is a flaw). Therefore, Proton Mail is not a good email provider.  The sentences in parentheses are implicit: I’ve formalized them as charitably as I can.\nThe first part is an extremely stringent condition. Unless there’s an email provider which has no flaws (and, to my knowledge, there isn’t since, for example, email providers have to comply with law enforcement), then the conclusion will apply to every email provider. Typically, this means inconsistency.\nI should note that I’m not including alternatives, like self-hosting, since this example only assumes a stringent condition about third-party email providers.\nNow, according to the Principle of Charity, let’s spell out the best version of the example argument:\n If an email provider logs customer IP addresses, then it’s not good. Proton Mail logged a customer’s IP address. Therefore, Proton Mail is not a good email provider.  There might be reason to say that it isn’t sound (i.e. it’s not very convincing), because the first part might not be a fair condition. However, while it follows all-or-nothing thinking, this argument at least avoids a stronger, fallacious form.\nThis is a great example of how the nirvana fallacy can occur—particularly as a result of neglecting to specify your conclusion. I’ll address this in the following section!\n“What can I do about it?” If we’re interested in driving productive discussion, then ensuring that we include context and specifying our conclusion is a great method of avoiding the nirvana fallacy. It’s not foolproof (viz. you can still make errors in your reasoning), but it at least gives an easy way to eliminate a few accidental cases. Example time.\n Someone asks whether hardened Firefox is a private and secure web-browser.  We answer that “there are advanced fingerprinting scripts which hardened Firefox can’t confidently resist”.    Clearly, this is a nuanced question, and—inevitably—depends on the person’s threat model. However, while we might have good reason for this point3, since we didn’t contextualize the answer, it’s left with an implicit (and erroneous) conclusion, just like the Proton Mail example:\n “(Due to this issue), no, hardened Firefox is not a private and secure web-browser.”\n But, wait: that’s not what we said! All we did was point-out something for consideration—if they draw that (implied) conclusion, then that’s on them. This is a fair point, and we don’t all have time to write an article on the ins-and-outs of evaluative discussion, but it’s straightforward to rectify:\n “There are advanced fingerprinting scripts which hardened Firefox can’t confidently resist. If those are important attack vectors for your threat model, then something like the Tor Browser might be more appropriate.”\n We should note that this extra context doesn’t go beyond our original comment: other people might respond with more holistic answers, or other considerations, but we were just pointing something out. The only difference in meaning is that there’s no longer an unintended, implicit conclusion (which also happens to be fallacious).\nThese cases can be fairly innocuous, by themselves: people are often smart enough to understand what you meant—even if the context is ambiguous. But, things can get hairy when we do it more than once, especially within the same answer:\n “There are advanced fingerprinting scripts which hardened Firefox can’t confidently resist. Firefox’s Fission site-isolation is less mature than Chromium’s, and has specific issues4. Mozilla depends on Google for a lot of their revenue.5”\n Similarly, we haven’t said that “no, hardened Firefox is not a private and secure web-browser”, but—since we haven’t specified our conclusion—raising these issues contributes to a tone which supports that implication.\nTo clarify our meaning, we don’t even need to address them individually. If we’re aiming to raise all of these points as something for the person to consider, then we can just say “this isn’t a “yes” or “no” answer, but these might be important things to consider”. Accidental fallacy avoided.\nOf course, it might be the case that we did actually intend the implicit conclusion. Even so, it’s helpful to specify it, after we justify our reasoning.\nI hope that these examples illustrate how specifying your conclusion can help to avoid miscommunication, accidental errors, and actually save time in the long-run.\nConclusion So, all-or-nothing thinking, the nirvana fallacy, and its stronger forms, can be detrimental to productive discussion. It’s important to avoid fallacies like these because it makes expressing our ideas and creating convincing arguments easier (which is great for discussion). Particularly in contexts where technical knowledge is advantageous, the nirvana fallacy is just one of the components that can lead to unfortunate consequences, like “gate-keeping”.\nHowever, if we commit errors like these unintentionally, and care about rectifying or avoiding them, then ensuring that we specify our conclusion and providing appropriate context can go a long way to reduce them.\nReferences   Also, see The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy*. ↩︎\n TechCrunch and Proton Transparency Report. ↩︎\n Arkenfox Wiki. ↩︎\n Madaidan’s Insecurities. ↩︎\n ZDNET. ↩︎\n   ",

<h3 id="what-is-the-nirvana-fallacy-and-why-is-it-important">What is the Nirvana fallacy, and why is it important?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-the-nirvana-fallacy-and-why-is-it-important">#</a></h3>
<p>As I mentioned, the Nirvana fallacy is a case of &ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo; or &ldquo;black-and-white&rdquo; thinking. Its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy">Wikipedia article</a> has some more information about it<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kai&rsquo;s article isn&rsquo;t going to get rid of the Nirvana fallacy, so it&rsquo;s not a very good article.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the goal of this article is to <em>reduce</em>, rather than <em>eradicate</em>, the Nirvana fallacy, this inference misses something important: what this article aims to do. Now, you might well still decide that this article isn&rsquo;t very good, but—if your reason was the same as the example—you would have made an error.</p>
<p>The nirvana fallacy is particularly important because it&rsquo;s so common—especially when it comes to important topics. Here, I&rsquo;m contextualizing its presence in discussions about topics related to the right to privacy (e.g. between activists, advocates, volunteers, experts, and so on), but the non-specific concepts can be generalized more broadly.</p>
<h3 id="why-avoid-fallacies">Why avoid fallacies?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-avoid-fallacies">#</a></h3>
<p>The advantage of avoiding fallacies, including this one, is that it&rsquo;s easier to make logically &lsquo;valid&rsquo; arguments. If an argument is valid, then it&rsquo;s often more convincing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to use a web-browser which respects your right to privacy. Google Chrome has a circular icon. Therefore, you should consider using an alternative, like Brave or Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We might agree with the first premise, but there&rsquo;s clearly an error in the conclusion we&rsquo;ve drawn: if the first two things are true, then our conclusion <em>should</em> also be true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to use a web-browser which respects your right to privacy. Google Chrome <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/03/20/stop-using-google-chrome-on-apple-iphone-12-pro-max-ipad-and-macbook-pro/?sh=602780eb4d08">doesn&rsquo;t</a> respect your right to privacy. Therefore, you should consider using an alternative, like Brave or Firefox.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conclusion seems more convincing because it&rsquo;s logically valid: if the first two things are true, then the conclusion seems reasonable. Now, of course, we might disagree with any of those statements, so our argument might not be &lsquo;sound&rsquo;, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>The point is that avoiding fallacies makes it easier to make good arguments (or, at least, arguments which are more convincing). If you&rsquo;re interested in exchanging ideas and discussing topics to progress everyone&rsquo;s understanding, then making good arguments is essential.</p>
<h2 id="fruit-and-vegetables">Fruit and Vegetables<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#fruit-and-vegetables">#</a></h2>
<p>Perhaps in characteristic style, I think that a vivid example might help to show why the nirvana fallacy is a particularly tricky case: it can lead to common practices, like &ldquo;gate-keeping&rdquo;, which aren&rsquo;t very useful for discussion.</p>
<h3 id="average-fruit-enjoyer-vs-fruit-and-vegetable-enthusiast">Average Fruit Enjoyer vs. Fruit-and-vegetable Enthusiast<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#average-fruit-enjoyer-vs-fruit-and-vegetable-enthusiast">#</a></h3>
<p>You&rsquo;re something of an enthusiast for fruit and vegetables. Sure, your friends and family eat them, here and there, but they aren&rsquo;t too bothered. The increase in eating processed foods has brought benefits like reducing harmful bacteria, making food quicker, easier, and less costly, and so on, but relying on it entirely has some drawbacks: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/food.htm">too much salt</a>, <a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-020-00604-1">adverse health effects</a>, and so on.</p>
<p><em>You</em>, on the other hand, are passionate about fruit and vegetables: you know that they&rsquo;re packed with <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/vegetables-and-fruits/">good stuff</a>; you think that people would see a lot of benefit from a few simple changes, like eating an apple-a-day; you even keep up with the latest developments (what the hell is a <a href="https://noshingwiththenolands.com/what-is-a-cucamelon/">&ldquo;cucamelon&rdquo;?</a>)</p>
<p>So, you find community with other fruit-and-vegetable advocates—a rich, diverse bunch of people: farmers, biologists, chefs, suppliers, consumers, policy-makers, nutritionists, and so on. Too many to count. Amongst you, the wide range of backgrounds, skill sets, and perspectives makes for great discussions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Which berries do you start your day with?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_fruit">aggregate fruits</a> just hype?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Is the botanical classification of tomatoes misleading?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, you&rsquo;re happy that you now only eat whole foods, blend your vegetables, grow your own produce, love hydroponics, and avoid processed sugar at all costs, but you can&rsquo;t wait until the next harvest and its potential for <em>even better</em> produce. Your current setup isn&rsquo;t perfect, yet. Also, you find yourself overwhelmed by the deluge of &lsquo;beginner&rsquo; topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like bananas: do I <em>have</em> to eat them?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Pineapple pizza should count as one of your five-a-day!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Best allergy-respecting alternative to kiwis?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>You can answer these fairly easily, but you&rsquo;re frustrated by the other answers. <strong>Obviously</strong>, if someone cares about their health, then things like &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay to not like particular foods&rdquo;, &ldquo;eating pizza isn&rsquo;t a sin&rdquo;, and &ldquo;try fruits that don&rsquo;t trigger birch pollen allergies, like oranges&rdquo; are <strong>stupid</strong>. Health is important. If you care about your health, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t like the food. Pizza isn&rsquo;t well-optimized for meeting a whole food diet, so it sucks. Just stop having allergies. Those are clear, for fruit-and-vegetable enthusiasts—like yourself.</p>
<p>However, you notice that some of the other enthusiasts are a lot more successful in helping people to include fruit and vegetables in their diets. They advise the average fruit enjoyer to &ldquo;try adding an apple to your lunchbox&rdquo; and &ldquo;add a few frozen peas to your instant ramen&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s weird: they aren&rsquo;t even optimal, so why is it successful?</p>
<p>This thinly-veiled analogy illustrates the &ldquo;gate-keeping&rdquo; that all-or-nothing thinking can lead to. When it comes to evaluation, the nirvana fallacy causes a particularly nasty trap: if nothing is good enough, then every option is bad.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-and-security">Privacy and Security<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#privacy-and-security">#</a></h3>
<p>For evaluative discussions about privacy and security, this can be detrimental to progress. In what follows, I&rsquo;ll include examples which are specific to discussions about digital privacy and security, but the same concepts apply. In some cases, the nirvana fallacy occurs directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Proton Mail is a bad email provider: they logged a customer&rsquo;s IP address<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at what the argument asserts:</p>
<ol>
<li>(An email provider is good only if it has no flaws).</li>
<li>Proton Mail logged a customer&rsquo;s IP address.</li>
<li>(Logging a customer&rsquo;s IP address is a flaw).</li>
<li>Therefore, Proton Mail is not a good email provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sentences in parentheses are <em>implicit</em>: I&rsquo;ve formalized them as charitably as I can.</p>
<p>The first part is an extremely stringent condition. Unless there&rsquo;s an email provider which has <strong>no flaws</strong> (and, to my knowledge, there isn&rsquo;t since, for example, email providers have to comply with law enforcement), then the conclusion will apply to <em>every email provider</em>. Typically, this means inconsistency.</p>
<p>I should note that I&rsquo;m not including alternatives, like self-hosting, since this example only assumes a stringent condition about third-party email providers.</p>
<p>Now, according to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity">Principle of Charity</a>, let&rsquo;s spell out the best version of the example argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>If an email provider logs customer IP addresses, then it&rsquo;s not good.</li>
<li>Proton Mail logged a customer&rsquo;s IP address.</li>
<li>Therefore, Proton Mail is not a good email provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>There might be reason to say that it isn&rsquo;t <strong>sound</strong> (i.e. it&rsquo;s not very convincing), because the first part might not be a fair condition. However, while it follows all-or-nothing thinking, this argument at least avoids a stronger, fallacious form.</p>
<p>This is a great example of how the nirvana fallacy can occur—particularly as a result of neglecting to specify your conclusion. I&rsquo;ll address this in the following section!</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-about-it">&ldquo;What can I do about it?&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-can-i-do-about-it">#</a></h2>
<p>If we&rsquo;re interested in driving productive discussion, then ensuring that we include context and specifying our conclusion is a great method of avoiding the nirvana fallacy. It&rsquo;s not foolproof (viz. you can still make errors in your reasoning), but it at least gives an easy way to eliminate a few accidental cases. Example time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone asks whether hardened Firefox is a private and secure web-browser.
<ul>
<li>We answer that &ldquo;there are advanced fingerprinting scripts which hardened Firefox can&rsquo;t confidently resist&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly, this is a nuanced question, and—inevitably—depends on the person&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/threat-modeling/">threat model</a>. However, while we might have good reason for this point<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, since we didn&rsquo;t contextualize the answer, it&rsquo;s left with an implicit (and erroneous) conclusion, just like the Proton Mail example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;(Due to this issue), <strong>no</strong>, hardened Firefox is <em>not</em> a private and secure web-browser.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, wait: that&rsquo;s not what we said! All we did was point-out something for consideration—if they draw that (implied) conclusion, then that&rsquo;s on them. This is a fair point, and we don&rsquo;t all have time to write an article on the ins-and-outs of evaluative discussion, but it&rsquo;s straightforward to rectify:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are advanced fingerprinting scripts which hardened Firefox can&rsquo;t confidently resist. If those are important attack vectors for your threat model, then something like the Tor Browser might be more appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should note that this extra context <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> go beyond our original comment: other people might respond with more holistic answers, or other considerations, but we were just pointing something out. The only difference in <em>meaning</em> is that there&rsquo;s no longer an unintended, implicit conclusion (which also happens to be fallacious).</p>
<p>These cases can be fairly innocuous, by themselves: people are often smart enough to understand what you <em>meant</em>—even if the context is ambiguous. But, things can get hairy when we do it more than once, especially within the same answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There are advanced fingerprinting scripts which hardened Firefox can&rsquo;t confidently resist. Firefox&rsquo;s Fission site-isolation is less mature than Chromium&rsquo;s, and has specific issues<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. Mozilla depends on Google for a lot of their revenue.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, we haven&rsquo;t <em>said</em> that &ldquo;<strong>no</strong>, hardened Firefox is <em>not</em> a private and secure web-browser&rdquo;, but—since we haven&rsquo;t specified our conclusion—raising these issues contributes to a tone which supports that implication.</p>
<p>To clarify our meaning, we don&rsquo;t even need to address them individually. If we&rsquo;re aiming to raise all of these points as something for the person to consider, then we can just say &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer, but these might be important things to consider&rdquo;. Accidental fallacy avoided.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be the case that we <em>did</em> actually intend the implicit conclusion. Even so, it&rsquo;s helpful to specify it, after we justify our reasoning.</p>
<p>I hope that these examples illustrate how specifying your conclusion can help to avoid miscommunication, accidental errors, and actually save time in the long-run.</p>

<p>So, all-or-nothing thinking, the nirvana fallacy, and its stronger forms, can be detrimental to productive discussion. It&rsquo;s important to avoid fallacies like these because it makes expressing our ideas and creating convincing arguments easier (which is great for discussion). Particularly in contexts where technical knowledge is advantageous, the nirvana fallacy is just one of the components that can lead to unfortunate consequences, like &ldquo;gate-keeping&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, if we commit errors like these unintentionally, and care about rectifying or avoiding them, then ensuring that we specify our conclusion and providing appropriate context can go a long way to reduce them.</p>

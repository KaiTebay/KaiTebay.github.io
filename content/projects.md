This page is a "living" list of my projects. You can use the table of contents to navigate to different projects.

## Privacy Guides

[Privacy Guides](https://privacyguides.org) is an open source project which provides up-to-date, evidence-based information that helps you [protect yourself online](https://www.privacyguides.org/#why-should-i-care).

I was a member of the [Privacy Guides team](https://www.privacyguides.org/about/#our-team).

Generally, I aimed to

- review cutting-edge research, to maintain awareness of emerging technologies and best-practices;
- review written content, to ensure the professional tone that Privacy Guides readers expect;
- contribute ideas and technical input to internal discussions;
- and, most importantly, advocate for digital freedoms!

## Freelance Design

Originally trading as "Kai Tebay Design", I started a freelance UX and UI design business.

> 💭 - A minimalist personal and project management dashboard, built entirely in Notion. 

It features 
- a sensible base, ready for database integration; 
- a streamlined and user-focused task-management design, based on [Bullet Journalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_journal) and, optionally, tight integration with [Todoist](https://todoist.com/);
- and a flexible management dashboard, appropriate for small businesses or individual projects.
- It comes in black, too.

## Academic Research

**BA Philosophy, University of Bristol**

I specialized in Philosophy of Science (particularly Physics, including Quantum Mechanics and Special and General Relativity), and completed additional extended research on Neuroscience and Meditation, and the Ethics of State Surveillance.

I also co-authored original research:

> Fryer, J. & K. Tebay. (2021) "Bridging the Gap between Ethical Holism and the Animal Liberation Movement", *BILT Journal in Philosophy*. Bristol: University of Bristol.
    
[`PDF`](https://bilt.online/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Bridging-the-Gap-between-Ethical-Holism-and-the-Animal-Liberation-Movement-Fryer-and-Tebay.pdf) | [Publication](https://bristol.ac.uk/bilt/student-engagement/student-research-journal/202021-student-research-journal/philosophy/)

During my degree, and aside from my independent research, institutional access to cutting-edge research let me access inspiring new ideas. Many of them helped to shape my values and further pursuits. Since then, I've been passionate about the aim of open education.

> I read quite a lot—from research papers to books and articles—and, while I love the old-school combo of a book and a hot drink, found myself looking for an eReader. For me, there are two main benefits: saving space when I travel, and avoiding distractions when I read.
> Although there are alternatives like [Kobo eReaders](https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ereaders) or the [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com/) tablet, among others, the Amazon Kindle was my first choice.

Depending on your [threat model](https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/threat-modeling/), you might prefer to avoid interacting with Amazon’s ecosystem. Following these steps, I’ve been using my Kindle Paperwhite for three years:

### Disconnecting Your Device 🔌

- Do not connect to a Wi-Fi network.
- Enable Aeroplane mode.

*Note: If you have already registered your device, you can deregister it from the “Account” section in your device settings.*

### Managing Reading Material 📚

- Kindle devices primarily use a file format called “[AZW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_File_Format)”, although it supports other formats (like PDF).
- [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is popularly used to convert reading material to AZW, edit document metadata, or transfer it to an eReader.
    You can also access the files on the local storage of your Kindle device directly, via USB.

### Acquiring Reading Material 📕

- [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/) - An open source, volunteer-driven project which curates and distributes e-books in the public domain.
- [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/) - A helpful project by the [Internet Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive) which aims to create “one web page for every book ever published”.

Happy reading!
